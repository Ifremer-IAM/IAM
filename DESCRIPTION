Description: IAM (Impact Assessment Model) is a bio-economic model 
    for the simulation of fisheries dynamics, 
    integrating specific decision support tools within the 
    framework of the theoretical implementation of management measures
    It is a discrete time, multi-fleet, multi-trade, multi-species annual 
    bio-economic model with "age" components for the biological part, 
    and "commercial category" components for the economic part.
