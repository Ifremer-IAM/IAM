IAM (Impact Assessment Model for fisheries management) is a bio-economic model developed as part of a partnership with stakeholders to support fisheries management. It is a tool for academic and non academic knowledge integration which models dynamics and interactions between fish stocks, vessels or fleets, fisheries governance and fish market. It is dedicated to scenario simulations and optimization, impact assessment of management strategies (transition to MSY, fisheries Management Plans, socio-economic consequences of alternative TAC and quotas allocation options) and exploration of conditions for fisheries viability and sustainability. It enables stochastic simulations of biological and socio-economic consequences of scenarios to compare trade-offs of aletrnative options from a multi-criteria perspective.

It is a discrete time (annual), multi-fleet or multi-vessel, multi-métier, multi-species bio-economic model with "age" components for the biological part, and "commercial category" components for the economic part.

You are free to copy, modify, and distribute `{IAM}` with attribution under the terms of the [CECILL-2 Licence](https://gitlab.ifremer.fr/iam/iam/-/blob/main/LICENCE-CECILL-2.1.txt). See the LICENSE-CECILL-2.1 file for details.

Note : the github repository is only a mirror from [gitlab](https://gitlab.ifremer.fr/iam/iam)



## Installation

`{IAM}` is a `R` package and thus require you to install it with a version superior to 3.6. Updating `R` (and Rstudio) is recommended before running a lot of package updates.

### From package repository (recommended)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("IAM", repos = "https://ifremer-iam.r-universe.dev")
```

<!-- This is CRAN-like -->

### From a package archive file

1. Go to the [Project 'Releases' page](https://gitlab.ifremer.fr/iam/iam/-/releases/) and download an `{IAM}` binary package (.zip format under Window, tar.gz format under Linux) coressponding with your `R` version. These are **not** the files listed in assets !

2. Install IAM dependencies if needed:
```{r, installdep, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_deps("--path to zipfile--/IAM_2.0.0.zip")
```


3. Install IAM from the archive file by entering the following command in the `R` prompt: 
```{r, installzip, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("--path to zipfile--/IAM_2.0.0.zip",
                 repos = NULL, type = "win.binary")
```

```{r, install_link, include = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("C:/Users/mjaunatr/Desktop/IAM_2.0.0.zip", repos = NULL, type = "win.binary")
```
<!-- ```{r, installlink, eval = FALSE} -->
<!-- # Also work with direct link  -->
<!-- install.packages("https://gitlab.ifremer.fr/iam/iam/uploads/1252e068a81c5c282bb1599686ef67df/IAM_2.0.0.zip", -->
<!--                  repos = NULL, type = "win.binary") -->
<!-- ``` -->


### From package source code

In order to build packages from sources on Windows, you will need `Rtools`, which is an independent software from `R`. You can install `Rtools` from the [CRAN project website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) after selecting the right version. Note that `Rtools 4.2` is still in development version. You can check your `R` version with `R.version`.

Install IAM from the sources files by entering the following command in the `R` prompt: 
```{r remotes_install, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_git(url = "https://gitlab.ifremer.fr/iam/iam")

# You can install development version with the ref option
remotes::install_git(
  url = "https://gitlab.ifremer.fr/iam/iam", 
  ref = "dev", 
  build_vignettes = require(rmarkdown)
)
```



## Documentation

For further information, all documentation is centralized in a [{pkgdown} website](https://ifremer-iam.github.io/IAM/index.html). IAM package has multiple vignettes available along with functions help. Please note that to this day, vignettes are written in french.

To get started, read [Use IAM vignette](https://ifremer-iam.github.io/IAM/articles/use_IAM.html).
You can also access a vignette by running this code locally :
```{r, eval = FALSE}
vignette("use_IAM", package = "IAM")
```


A more in depth notice in french is available if you need to check the model implementation and mathematical formula. The pdf file is available for [download here](https://gitlab.ifremer.fr/iam/iam/-/raw/main/inst/notice/Notice_IAM.pdf?inline=false)
